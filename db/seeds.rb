# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
Student.create(first_name: "ZHENGJIAN", last_name: "LIU")
Student.create(first_name: "FirstName", last_name: "Lastname")
